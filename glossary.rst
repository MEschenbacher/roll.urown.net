    3DES

        `Triple DES (3DES) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3DES>`_ is the common
        name for the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA or Triple DEA)
        symmetric-key block cipher, which applies the Data Encryption Standard
        (DES) cipher algorithm three times to each data block. While in theory
        it has 168 bits of security, the practical security it provides is only
        112 bits. To make things worse, there are known attacks against it, so
        that effectively it compares to about 80 bits security.

    802.11
    IEEE 802.11

        `IEEE 802.11 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11>`_ is a set of
        :term:`media access control` (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) specifications for
        implementing wireless local area network (WLAN) computer communication in the
        900 MHz and 2.4, 3.6, 5, and 60 GHz frequency bands. They are the world's most
        widely used wireless computer networking standards, used in most home and
        office networks to allow laptops, printers, and smartphones to talk to each
        other and access the Internet without connecting wires. They are created and
        maintained by the :term:`Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers`
        (IEEE) LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802). The base version of the
        standard was released in 1997, and has had subsequent amendments. The standard
        and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the Wi-Fi
        brand. While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in
        the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the
        revisions because they concisely denote capabilities of their products. As a
        result, in the marketplace, each revision tends to become its own standard.

    802.11a
        TBD


    802.11ac
    IEEE 802.11ac

        `IEEE 802.11ac <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ac>`_ is a wireless
        networking standard in the :term:`802.11` family (which is marketed under the
        brand name :term:`Wi-Fi`), developed in the :term:`IEEE` Standards
        Association, providing high-throughput wireless local area networks
        (:term:`WLAN`) on the 5 GHz band. The standard was developed from 2008
        through 2013 and published in December 2013.

        The specification has multi-station throughput of at least **1 Gbit/s** and
        single-link throughput of at least **500 Mbit/s**. This is accomplished by
        extending the air-interface concepts embraced by :term:`802.11n`: wider RF
        bandwidth (up to 160 MHz), more :term:`MIMO` spatial streams (up to eight),
        downlink multi-user MIMO (up to four clients), and high-density modulation (up
        to 256-:term:`QAM`).

        The first 802.11ac products from 2013 are referred to as **Wave 1**, and the
        newer higher bandwidth products introduced in 2016 are referred to as **Wave
        2**.


    802.11ax
    IEEE 802.11ax

        `IEEE 802.11ax <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ax>`_ is a type of
        WLAN in the :term:`IEEE 802.11` set of types of :term:`WLAN`. IEEE 802.11ax is
        designed to operate in the already existing 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz spectrums. In
        addition to utilizing :term:`MIMO` and :term:`MU-MIMO`, the new amendment
        introduces :term:`OFDMA` to improve overall spectral efficiency, and higher
        order 1024 :term:`QAM` modulation support for increased throughput. Though the
        nominal data rate is just 37% higher than :term:`IEEE 802.11ac`, the new
        amendment is expected to achieve a 4x increase to user throughput—due to more
        efficient spectrum utilization.

        IEEE 802.11ax is due to be publicly released sometime in 2019. Devices were
        presented at CES 2018 that showed a top speed of **11 Gbps**.


    802.11b
    IEEE 802.11b

        `IEEE 802.11b-1999 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11b-1999>`_  or
        802.11b, is an amendment to the :term:`IEEE 802.11` wireless networking
        specification that extends throughput up to **11 Mbit/s** using the same
        2.4GHz band. A related amendment was incorporated into the IEEE  802.11-2007
        standard.


    802.11e
    IEEE 802.11e

        See also :term:`WMM`.

        `IEEE 802.11e-2005 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11e-2005>`_  or
        802.11e is an approved amendment to the :term:`IEEE 802.11` standard that
        defines a set of :term:`quality of service` (QoS) enhancements for  wireless
        LAN applications through modifications to the :term:`Media Access  Control`
        (MAC) layer. The standard is considered of critical importance  for delay-
        sensitive applications, such as :term:`Voice over Wireless LAN` and streaming
        multimedia. The amendment has been incorporated into the  published IEEE
        802.11-2007 standard.


    802.11g
    IEEE 802.11g

        `IEEE 802.11g-2003 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11g-2003>`_ or
        802.11g is an amendment to the :term:`IEEE 802.11` specification that extended
        throughput to up to **54 Mbit/s** using the same 2.4 GHz band as
        :term:`802.11b`. This specification under the marketing name of :term:`Wi-Fi`
        has been implemented all over the world. The 802.11g protocol is now Clause 19
        of the published IEEE 802.11-2007 standard, and Clause 19 of the published
        IEEE 802.11-2012 standard.


    802.11n
    IEEE 802.11n

        `IEEE 802.11n-2009 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009>`_, 
        commonly shortened to 802.11n, is a wireless-networking standard that
        uses multiple antennas to increase data rates. Sometimes referred to
        as MIMO, which stands for "multiple input and multiple output", it is
        an amendment to the IEEE 802.11-2007 wireless-networking standard. Its
        purpose is to improve network throughput over the two previous
        standards — :term:`802.11a` and :term:`802.11g` — with a significant
        increase in the maximum net data rate from 54 Mbit/s to **600 Mbit/s**
        (slightly higher gross bit rate including for example error-correction
        codes, and slightly lower maximum throughput) with the use of four
        spatial streams at a channel width of 40 MHz. 802.11n standardized
        support for multiple-input multiple-output, frame aggregation, and
        security improvements, among other features. It can be used in the 2.4
        GHz or 5 GHz frequency bands.

        Development of 802.11n began in 2002, seven years before publication.
        The 802.11n protocol is now Clause 20 of the published IEEE
        :term:`802.11`-2012 standard.


    802.11w 
    Management Frame Protection
    MFP

        `IEEE 802.11w-2009 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11w-2009>`_ is an
        approved amendment to the :term:`IEEE 802.11` standard to increase the
        security of its management frames.

    AES
    Advanced Encryption Standard

        `The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard>`_ is a is a
        symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of electronic data established by a
        U.S. Governement institution (NIST) in 2001. AES has been adopted by the U.S.
        government for top secret information and is used worldwide today. It
        supersedes the :term:`Data Encryption Standard` (DES).


    AES-NI
    Advanced Encryption Standard Instruction Set

        `Advanced Encryption Standard Instruction Set (or AES-NI)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set>`_ is an extension of
        the x86 CPU architecture from Intel and AMD. It accelarates data
        encryption and decryption if the :term:`Advanced Encryption Standard`
        (AES) is used by an application.


    AXFR
    DNS zone transfer

        `DNS zone transfer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_zone_transfer>`_,
        also sometimes known by the inducing DNS query type AXFR, is a type of
        DNS transaction. A zone transfer uses TCP for transport, and takes the
        form of a client–server transaction. The client requesting a zone
        transfer may be a slave server or secondary server, requesting data from
        a master server, sometimes called a primary server. The portion of the
        database that is replicated is a zone. Avoid if possible and use other
        more secure replication methods. See also `What are zone transfers?
        <https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/tcp.html#intro-axfr>`_ from Daniel Bernstein.


    Bayesian Filter
    Bayesian Filtering
    Bayesian Spam Filter

        A `Bayesian spam filter
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_spam_filtering>`_ (after Rev.
        Thomas Bayes) is a statistical technique of e-mail filtering. In its
        basic form, it makes use of a naive Bayes classifier on bag of words
        features to identify spam e-mail, an approach commonly used in text
        classification.


    Blowfish
        `Blowfish <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_(cipher)>`_ is a
        symmetric-key block cipher, designed in 1993 by Bruce Schneier and
        included in a large number of cipher suites and encryption products.
        Blowfish provides a good encryption rate in software and no effective
        cryptanalysis of it has been found to date. However, the :term:`Advanced
        Encryption Standard` (:term:`AES`) now receives more attention. Blowfish
        users are encouraged by Bruce Schneier, Blowfish's creator, to use the
        more modern and computationally efficient alternative :term:`Twofish`.


    CA
    Certificate Authority
        TBD

    Chip card
    ICC
    Integrated Circuit Card
    Smart card
    Smartcard
 
        A pocket-sized plastic card with embedded integrated circuits. Smart
        cards can provide identification, authentication, data storage and
        application processing. See the `Wikipedia article
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card>`_ for many possible usage
        scenarios.


    Cipher Suite
        A cipher suite is a standardized collection of key exchange algorithms,
        encryption algorithms (ciphers) and Message authentication codes
        (:term:`MAC`) algorithm that provides authenticated encryption schemes.
        For more information see [KAea14b]_.


    Composer

        `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`_ is a tool for dependency management in
        PHP. It allows a developer to declare the dependent libraries a project needs
        and it will install them along the project.


    Cryptographic Hash Function

        A `cryptographic hash function
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function>`_ is a hash
        function which is considered practically impossible to invert, that is, to
        recreate the input data from its hash value alone. They are used for digital
        signatures, message authentication codes (:term:`MAC`), and other forms of
        authentication. It can also be used as ordinary :term:`hash function`, to
        index data in hash tables, for fingerprinting, to detect duplicate data or
        uniquely identify files, and as checksums to detect accidental data
        corruption. Cryptographic hash values are sometimes called (digital)
        fingerprints, checksums, or just hash values. Some widely used ones are:
        :term:`MD5`, :term:`SHA-1`, :term:`SHA-256`


    Curve25519

        In cryptography, `Curve25519 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519>`_ is
        an elliptic curve offering 128 bits of security and designed for use with the
        :term:`elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman` (:term:`ECDH`) key agreement scheme. It
        is one of the fastest :term:`ECC` curves and is not covered by any known
        patents. Curve25519 was first released by Daniel J. Bernstein in 2005, but
        interest increased considerably after 2013 when it was discovered that the NSA
        had implemented a backdoor into :term:`Dual EC DRBG`. While not directly
        related, suspicious aspects of the :term:`NIST P curves` led to concerns that
        the NSA had chosen values that gave them an advantage in factoring public
        keys.


    Daemon

        Long-running programs usually running in the background and providing
        services for other programs and or clients on other systems connected by
        a network. Daemons typically are started automatically on system boot
        and run on their own, without any user interaction.


    DANE
    DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities

        `DNS based Authentication of Named Entities <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities>`_
        (DANE) is a protocol to allow :term:`X.509` certificates, commonly used for
        :term:`Transport Layer Security` (:term:`TLS`), to be bound to :term:`DNS`
        names using :term:`Domain Name System Security Extensions` (:term:`DNSSEC`).
        It is proposed in :RFC:`6698` as a way to authenticate TLS client and server
        entities without a :term:`certificate authority` (CA).


    Delegation-Signing
        TBD


    DES
    Data Encryption Standard

        The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a previously predominant symmetric-key
        algorithm for the encryption of electronic data. It is now considered to be
        insecure. This is chiefly due to the 56-bit key size being too small; in
        January, 1999, distributed.net and the :term:`Electronic Frontier Foundation`
        collaborated to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15 minutes. The
        cipher has been superseded by the :term:`Advanced Encryption Standard` (AES)
        and has been withdrawn as a standard. DES was developed in the early 1970s at
        IBM. **Do not use!**


    DH
    Diffie-Hellman key exchange

        `Diffie–Hellman key exchange (DH) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie-Hellman_key_exchange>`_ 
        is a specific method of exchanging cryptographic keys.
        The method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to
        jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure communications channel.
        This key can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a
        symmetric key cipher. Youtube has a `great video
        <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QnD2c4Xovk>`_ that explains it in 5 minutes.


    DH Parameters
        DH parameters are pre-generated large prime-numbers, which accelerates
        the  generatation of session keys while using :term:`Diffie-Hellman key
        exchange`. To find and evaluate such prime numbers takes a long time
        (up to several minutes). Using pre-generated values allows to establish
        session keys during initial handshake and periodic renevals, without any
        noticeable delay.


    Digital Fingerprint
        See :term:`Cryptographic Hash Function`.


    DNS
    Domain Name System
        TBD


    DNSSEC
    Domain Name System Security Extensions

        The `Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions>`_ is a
        suite of :term:`Internet Engineering Task Force` (:term:`IETF`) specifications
        for securing certain kinds of information provided by the Domain Name System
        (DNS) as used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It is a set of extensions to
        DNS which provide to DNS clients (resolvers) origin authentication of DNS
        data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity, but not
        availability or confidentiality.


    DSA
    Digital Signature Algorithm
        `The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm>`_
        is a Federal Information Processing Standard for digital signatures.
        In August 1991 the National Institute of Standards and Technology
        (:term:`NIST`) proposed DSA for use in their Digital Signature
        Standard (DSS) and adopted it 1994 in its :term:`FIPS` standards
        specification. Four revisions to the initial specification have been
        released in 1996, 2000, 2009 and in 2013.

        DSA is covered by a U.S. Patent and attributed to a former NSA
        employee. The patent was given to the United States, and NIST has made
        it available worldwide royalty-free. DSA is a variant of the ElGamal
        signature scheme.


    Dual EC DRBG
    Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator

        Dual EC DRBG (Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator) is
        an algorithm that was presented as a cryptographically secure
        pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) using methods in :term:`elliptic
        curve cryptography`. Despite wide public criticism, including a
        potential backdoor, for seven years it was one of the four (now three)
        CSPRNGs standardized in NIST SP 800-90A as originally published circa
        June 2006, until *withdrawn in 2014*.


    ECC
    Elliptic Curve Cryptography
    Elliptic-Curve Cryptography

        `Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography>`_ is an
        approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of
        elliptic curves over finite fields. ECC requires smaller keys compared
        to non-ECC cryptography (based on plain Galois fields) to provide
        equivalent security.[1]


    ECDH
    Elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman

        `Elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie-Hellman>`_ is an
        anonymous key agreement protocol that allows two parties, each having an
        elliptic curve public–private key pair, to establish a shared secret
        over an insecure channel. This shared secret may be directly  used as a
        key, or better yet, to derive another key which can then be used to
        encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric key cipher. It is a
        variant of the :term:`Diffie-Hellman key exchange` using :term:`elliptic
        curve cryptography`.


    ECDSA
    Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm

        In cryptography, the 
        `Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm>`_
        offers a variant of the Digital Signature Algorithm (:term:`DSA`)
        which uses elliptic curve cryptography.


    Ed25519
    EdDSA

        In public-key cryptography, `Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm
        (EdDSA) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA>`_ is a digital signature
        scheme using a variant of Schnorr signature based on Twisted Edwards
        curves. It is designed to be faster than existing digital signature
        schemes without sacrificing security. It was developed by a team
        including Daniel J. Bernstein, Niels Duif, Tanja Lange, Peter Schwabe,
        and Bo-Yin Yang. The reference implementation is public domain software.

    ESMTP

        `Extended SMTP (ESTMP) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_SMTP>`_
        includes additions made to :term:`SMTP` who where defined in 2008 in
        :rfc:`5321`. It is in widespread use today. Like SMTP, ESMTP uses TCP
        port 25.


    Filter Bubble
        A `filter bubble <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble>`_ is a
        result of a personalized search in which a website algorithm selectively
        guesses what information a user would like to see based on information
        about the user (such as location, past click behavior and search
        history) and, as a result, users become separated from information that
        disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them in their own
        cultural or ideological bubbles. The term was coined by internet
        activist Eli Pariser in his book by the same name [ARNea]_. The bubble
        effect may have negative implications for civic discourse, according to
        Pariser, but there are contrasting views suggesting the effect is
        minimal and addressable.


    FIPS
        `Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards>`_
        are publicly announced standards developed by the US Government trough
        its National Institute of Standards and Technology (:term:`NIST`) for
        use in computer systems by non-military government agencies and
        government contractors.

        FIPS standards are issued to establish requirements for various
        purposes such as ensuring computer security and interoperability, and
        are intended for cases in which suitable industry standards do not
        already exist. Many FIPS specifications are modified versions of
        standards used in the technical communities, such as the American
        National Standards Institute (ANSI), the Institute of Electrical and
        Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the International Organization for
        Standardization (ISO).

        These include amongst others, encryption standards, such as the
        Digital Signature Algorithm (:term:`DSA`), Data Encryption Standard
        (:term:`DES`) and the Advanced Encryption Standard (:term:`AES`).


    Firmware
        `Firmware <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware>`_ is essentially
        software that is very closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to
        need frequent updates. Typically stored in non-volatile memory chips
        such as :term:`ROM`, EPROM, or flash memory. Since it can only be
        updated or replaced by special procdures designed by the hardware
        manufacturer, it is somewhat on the boundary between *hardware* and
        *software*; thus the name *"firmware"*.


    Forward Secrecy
    FS
    Perfect Forward Secrecy
    PFS

        In cryptography, forward secrecy is a property of key-agreement
        protocols ensuring that a session key derived from a set of long-term
        keys cannot be compromised if one of the long-term keys (like the
        servers private key) is compromised in the future. Usually either
        :term:`Diffie-Hellman key exchange` or :term:`Elliptic curve
        Diffie–Hellman` are used to create and exchange session keys.

        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning>`_ is a security
        mechanism introduced in 2015 with :rfc:`7469` delivered via an HTTP
        header which allows HTTPS websites to resist impersonation by attackers
        using mis-issued or otherwise fraudulent certificates. In order to do so,
        it delivers a set of public keys to the client (browser), which should
        be the only ones trusted for connections to this domain. In practice it
        was newer largely adopted. For website owners and is difficult and risky
        to maintain. Therefore Google
        `announced <https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/he9tr7p3rZ8/eNMwKPmUBAAJ?hn>`_
        in October 2017 to deprecate and later remove the HPKP feature from the
        Chrome browser.

    IETF
    Internet Engineering Task Force

        The `IETF <https://ietf.org/about/>`_ is a large open international community
        of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers concerned with the
        evolution of the Internet architecture and the smooth operation of the
        Internet. The technical work of the IETF is done in Working Groups, which are
        organized by topic into several Areas.

        These working groups develop and promote the voluntary Internet standards, in
        particular the standards that comprise the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP).
        These are typically published as :term:`RFC`. It is an open standards
        organization, with no formal membership or membership requirements. All
        participants and managers are volunteers, though their work is usually funded
        by their employers or sponsors.

        The IETF started out as an activity supported by the U.S. federal government,
        but since 1993 it has operated as a standards development function under the
        auspices of the Internet Society, an international membership-based non-profit
        organization.


    IMAP
        `Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imap>`_ is a protocol for email
        retrieval and storage by the :term:`MUA` from the :term:`MAS`. It was
        devloped as an alternative to :term:`POP`. IMAP unlike :term:`POP`,
        specifically allows multiple clients simultaneously connected to the
        same mailbox, and through flags stored on the server, different clients
        accessing the same mailbox at the same or different times can detect
        state changes made by other clients. The IMAP protocol uses TCP port 143
        and TCP port 993 for :term:`SSL` secured IMAPS connections.

        SMTP Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) is a
        mechanism enabling mail service providers to declare their ability to
        receive Transport Layer Security (:term:`TLS`) secure :term:`SMTP`
        connections, and to specify whether sending SMTP servers should refuse
        to deliver to MX hosts that do not offer TLS with a trusted server
        certificate.

    MUA
    Message User Agent
        The software program in charge of retrieving messages from a users
        mailbox on a :term:`MAS` or :term:`Mail Access Server`, usually using
        either :term:`IMAP` or :term:`POP3` protocols. The MUA might also submit
        mail messages to the :term:`MSA` or :term:`Message Submission Agent`
        using the :term:`Submission` protocol. MUAs are commonly known as mail
        clients. Known MUA software product examples are Microsoft Outlook or

    National Institute of Standards and Technology
        The `National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology>`_
        is a measurement standards laboratory, and a non-regulatory agency of
        the United States Department of Commerce. Its mission is to promote
        innovation and industrial competitiveness. In 2013 the newspapers
        Guardian and New York Times reported that NIST allowed the
        :term:`National Security Agency` (:term:`NSA`) to insert a
        cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator called
        :term:`Dual EC DRBG` into NIST standard SP 800-90 that had a
        kleptographic backdoor that the NSA can use to covertly predict the
        future outputs of this pseudorandom number generator thereby allowing
        the surreptitious decryption of data.

    NTP
    Network Time Protocol

        `Network Time Protocol <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol>`_
        (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer
        systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. In operation
        since before 1985, NTP is one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use.

        NTP is intended to synchronize all participating computers to within a few
        milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It is designed to mitigate
        the effects of variable network latency. NTP can usually maintain time to
        within tens of milliseconds over the public Internet, and can achieve better
        than one millisecond accuracy in local area networks under ideal conditions.
        Asymmetric routes and network congestion can cause errors of 100 ms or more.

    OPDS
    Open Publication Distribution System
        The `Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPDS>`_ is a way for electronic book
        reading devices to access catalogs of books and download books itself
        from a web server. Its specification is prepared by an informal grouping
        of partners, combining Internet Archive, O'Reilly Media, Feedbooks, OLPC,
        and others.


    PEM
        
        `Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Enhanced_Mail>`_ is a 1993
        :term:`IETF` proposal for securing email using public-key
        cryptography. Although PEM became an IETF proposed standard it was
        never widely deployed or used.

    RC4

        `RC4 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4>`_ is the most widely used
        software stream cipher and  is used in popular protocols such as
        Transport Layer Security (TLS) and  WEP (to secure wireless networks).
        While remarkable for its simplicity and speed in software, RC4 has
        weaknesses that argue against its use in new systems. As of 2013, there
        is speculation that some state cryptologic agencies may possess the
        capability to break RC4 even when used in the TLS protocol.
        **RC4 should disabled and avoided wherever possible!**


    RFC

        A `Request for Comments (RFC)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments>`_ is a publication of the
        :term:`Internet Engineering Task Force` (:term:`IETF`) and the Internet
        Society, the principal technical development and standards-setting bodies for
        the Internet.


    ROM
    Read-Only Memory

        Read-only memory (ROM) is a class of storage medium used in computers
        and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be modified
        slowly, with difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used to
        distribute :term:`firmware`.


    RSA
        `RSA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29>`_ is one of
        the first practicable public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for
        secure data transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is
        public and differs from the decryption key which is kept secret. RSA
        stands for Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who first
        publicly described the algorithm in 1977. Youtube has `this video
        <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXB-V_Keiu8>`_ that explains it in 16
        minutes.


    Salt
        In cryptography, a `salt
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_%28cryptography%29>`_ is random data
        that is used as an additional input to a :term:`cryptographic hash
        function` on a password or passphrase. The primary function of salts is
        to defend against dictionary attacks versus a list of password hashes
        and against pre- computed :term:`rainbow table` attacks. A new salt is
        randomly generated for each password. In a typical setting, the salt and
        the password are concatenated and processed with a :term:`cryptographic
        hash function`, and the resulting output (but not the original password)
        is stored with the salt in a database. Hashing allows for later
        authentication while defending against compromise of the plaintext
        password in the event that the database is somehow compromised.
        Cryptographic salts are broadly used in many modern computer systems,
        from Unix system credentials to Internet security.


    SHA
    SHA1
    SHA-1
        `SHA-1 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA1>`_ is a :term:`cryptographic
        hash function` designed by the NSA and is a U.S. Governement Standard
        published by the United States NIST in 1995. SHA stands for "secure hash
        algorithm". In 2005, analysts found attacks on SHA-1 suggesting
        that the algorithm might not be secure enough for ongoing use. The U.S,
        the German and other governements are required to move to SHA-2 after
        2010 because of the weakness. Windows will stop accepting SHA-1
        certificates by 2017. Hoever a large part of todays commercial
        certificate authorities still only issue SHA-1 signed certificates.
        **Avoid where possible!**


    SHA2
    SHA-2
    SHA-224
    SHA-256
    SHA-384
    SHA-512
    SHA-512/224

        `SHA-2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA2>`_ is :term:`cryptographic
        hash function`, published in 2001 by the US governement (NSA & NIST), is
        significantly different from :term:`SHA-1`. SHA-2 currently consists of
        a set of six hash functions with digests that are 224, 256, 384 or 512
        bits.


    Sieve
        `Sieve <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_%28mail_filtering_language%29>`_
        is a programming language that can be used to create filters for email.
        Sieve's base specification is outlined in :rfc:`5228`.




    SMTP
        The `Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP>`_ is the protool used by a
        :term:`MTA` to transmit mails between Internet domains. First defined
        by :rfc:`821` in 1982, it was last updated in 2008 as :term:`ESMTP`.
        SMTP by default uses TCP port 25. SMTP connections secured by SSL, known
        as :term:`SMTPS`, default to TCP port 465.


    SMTPS
        `Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Secure
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTPS>`_ was a way to provide
        :term:`SSL` secured :term:`SMTP` connections on TCP port 465. SMTPS
        has been revoked in favor of :term:`Submission` in 1998 and today TCP
        port 465 is reserved for other purposes. Nonetheless many mail service
        providers still provide this service on port 465 today.

        TBD.


    SSL
    Secure Sockets Layer

        Secure Sockets Layer is the predecessor of :term:`Transport Layer
        Security` (:term:`TLS`).


    STARTTLS
    Opportunistic TLS
        `Opportunistic TLS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS>`_
        (Transport Layer Security) refers to extensions in plain text
        communication protocols, which offer a way to upgrade a plain text
        connection to an encrypted (:term:`TLS` or SSL) connection instead of
        using a separate port for encrypted communication. Several protocols
        use a command named "STARTTLS" for this purpose. It is primarily
        intended as a countermeasure to passive monitoring.
        The STARTTLS command for :term:`IMAP` and :term:`POP3` is defined in
        :rfc:`2595`, for :term:`SMTP` in :rfc:`3207`, for :term:`XMPP` in
        :rfc:`6120` and for :term:`NNTP` in :rfc:`4642`. For :term:`IRC`, the
        IRCv3 Working Group has defined the STARTTLS extension. :term:`FTP`
        uses the command "AUTH TLS" defined in :rfc:`4217` and :term:`LDAP`
        defines a protocol extension OID in :rfc:`2830`. :term:`HTTP` uses
        upgrade header.


    Stock ROM
        Original :term:`firmware` of a device as supplied by the manufacturer on
        a programmable :term:`ROM`. The term is mostly used in the context where
        a third party provides alternative :term:`firmware` which may enhance or
        otherwise change the functionality of a device, beyond the intentions of
        its original manufacturer.


    Submission
        Message Submission for Mail is a protocol defined in :rfc:`6409` and
        used by mail clients (:term:`MSA`, :term:`MUA`) to submit electronic
        mail for further delivery on the internet. It is essentially
        :term:`SMTP`, but with mandatory :term:`TLS`-encrpytion and user
        authentication added and running on TCP port 587.


    TLDR
    TL;DR
        "Too Long; Didn't Read".


    TLS
    Transport Layer Security

        Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, :term:`Secure Sockets
        Layer` (SSL), are cryptographic protocols designed to  provide communication
        security over the Internet. They use :term:`X.509` certificates and hence
        asymmetric cryptography to authenticate the counterparty with whom they are
        communicating, and to exchange a symmetric key. This session key is then used
        to encrypt data flowing between the parties. This allows for data/message
        confidentiality, and message authentication codes for message integrity and as
        a by-product, message authentication.


    TLSA
        A TLSA DNS record publishes information on certificates used by a
        :term:`TLS` secured server. Clients (e.g webbrowsers) can verify the TLS
        certificate of a server by checking the TLSA DNS record instead of or
        additionally to check if the certificates is singned by a trusted
        certificate authority. TLSA is part of the :term:`DANE` specfication.
        Domains publishing TLSA records must be secured by :term:`DNSSEC`.


    TOFU

        `Trust on first use (TOFU) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_on_first_use>`_,
        or trust upon first use (TUFU), is a security model used by client
        software which needs to establish a trust relationship with an
        unknown or not-yet-trusted endpoint. In a TOFU model, the client will
        try to look up the identifier, usually some kind of public key, in
        its local trust database. If no identifier exists yet for the
        endpoint, the client software will either prompt the user to
        determine if the client should trust the identifier or it will simply
        trust the identifier which was given and record the trust
        relationship into its trust database. If a different identifier is
        received in subsequent connections to the endpoint the client
        software will consider it to be untrusted.

        The TOFU approach can be used when connecting to arbitrary or unknown
        endpoints which do not have a trusted third party such as a
        certificate authority. For example, the :term:`SSH` protocol is
        designed to issue a prompt the first time the client connects to an
        unknown or not-yet-trusted endpoint. Other implementations of TOFU can
        be found in :term:`HTTP Public Key Pinning` in which browsers will
        always accept the first public key returned by the server and with
        :term:`HTTP Strict Transport Security` in which browsers will obey the
        redirection rule for the duration of 'age' directive.


    Twofish

        In cryptography, `Twofish <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twofish>`_ is a
        symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits and key sizes
        up to 256 bits. It was one of the five finalists of the Advanced
        Encryption Standard contest, but it was not selected for
        standardization. Twofish is related to the earlier block cipher
        :term:`Blowfish`.

        `Wireless Multimedia Extensions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Multimedia_Extensions>`_
        (WME), also known as Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM), is a Wi-Fi Alliance 
        interoperability certification, based on the :term:`IEEE 802.11e` standard. It 
        provides basic :term:`Quality of service` (QoS) features to :term:`IEEE 802.11` 
        networks. WMM prioritizes traffic according to four Access Categories 
        (AC): voice (AC_VO), video (AC_VI), best effort (AC_BE), and background 
        (AC_BK). However, it does not provide guaranteed throughput. It is 
        suitable for well-defined applications that require QoS, such as :term:`Voice 
        over IP` (VoIP) on Wi-Fi phones (:term:`VoWLAN`).

        WMM is mandatory for :term:`802.11n`. If you disable WMM you also
        disable 802.11n and your wirelless network will automatically fall
        back to :term:`802.11g`

        The 802.11 workgroup has documented use in five distinct frequency
        ranges: 2.4 GHz, 3.6 GHz, 4.9 GHz, 5 GHz, and 5.9 GHz bands. Each
        range is divided into a multitude of channels. Countries apply their
        own regulations to the allowable channels, allowed users and maximum
        power levels within these frequency ranges.

        A `List of WLAN Channels <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels>`_ 
        is available at Wikipedia.


    WPS
    Wi-Fi Protected Setup

        Originally called, Wi-Fi Simple Config, 
        `WiFi Protected Setup <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup>`_
        is a network security standard to create a secure wireless home network.

        Created by the Wi-Fi Alliance and introduced in 2006, the goal of the
        protocol is to allow home users who know little of wireless security
        and may be intimidated by the available security options to set up Wi-
        Fi Protected Access, as well as making it easy to add new devices to
        an existing network without entering long passphrases. Prior to the
        standard, several competing solutions were developed by different
        vendors to address the same need.

        A major security flaw was revealed in December 2011 that affects
        wireless routers with the WPS PIN feature, which most recent models
        have enabled by default. The flaw allows a remote attacker to recover
        the WPS PIN in a few hours with a brute-force attack and, with the WPS
        PIN, the network's WPA/WPA2 pre-shared key. Users have been urged
        to turn off the WPS PIN feature.

    X.509
        In cryptography, X.509 is an ITU-T standard for a public key
        infrastructure (PKI) and Privilege Management Infrastructure (PMI).
        X.509 specifies, amongst other things, standard formats for public key
        certificates, certificate revocation lists, attribute certificates, and
        a certification path validation algorithm.

    XMPP
        `Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmpp>`_  is a communications protocol for
        message-oriented middleware based on XML (Extensible Markup Language).
        The protocol was originally named Jabber and was developed by the Jabber
        open-source community in 1999 for near real-time, instant messaging (IM),
        presence information, and contact list maintenance.
