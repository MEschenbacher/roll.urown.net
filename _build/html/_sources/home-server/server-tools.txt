* htop

.. _increase-entropy:

Provide Entropy
================

.. warning::
   This is absolutely necessary for generation of encryption keys and 
   encryption of communication!

* **Pollinate** seeds the pseudo random number generator by connecting to one or
  more Pollen (entropy-as-a-service) servers over an (optionally) encrypted 
  connection and retrieve a random seed over HTTP or HTTPS. It is intended to 
  supplement the :file:`/etc/init.d/urandom` init script.

* **haveged** uses HAVEGE (HArdware Volatile Entropy Gathering and Expansion) to 
  maintain a 1M pool of random bytes used to fill `/dev/random` whenever the 
  supply of random bits in :file:`dev/random` falls below the low water mark of the 
  device.

To install these run::

   $ sudo apt-get install pollinate haveged

*haveged* is installed as services and automatically started. *pollinate* is 
started once every time the server starts up.
