SSH
===

.. contents::


.. note::

    The following is valid for *OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 Ubuntu-2ubuntu2, OpenSSL 1.0.1f 6
    Jan 2014* as shipped with Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS "Trusty Thar"


SSH Server 
----------

.. warning::
    
    Please be advised that any change in the SSH-Settings of your server might
    cause problems connecting to the server or starting/reloading the SSH-Daemon
    itself. So every time you configure your SSH-Settings on a remote server via
    SSH itself, ensure that you have a second open connection to the server,
    which you can use to reset or adapt your changes!


Re-create Server Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After we improved our systems :doc:`/server/entropy`, its time to discard the 
old SSH server keys, who have been created by the Ubuntu server installation 
process, with a 
`fresh set <http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/en/man1/ssh-keygen.1.html>`_

::

    cd /etc/ssh
    sudo rm ssh_host_*key*
    sudo ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ssh_host_ed25519_key
    sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ssh_host_rsa_key


.. note::

    Don't forget to re-distribute the new server public keys to any SSH clients 
    you connect to from this host.

Note that we only created *ed25519* and *RSA* keys. Other types are not
recommended.

The supported key types depend on the SSH software version. Both client and
server must support it. You can check which key types are supported by your version of
OpenSSH with the command :file:`ssh -Q key`.


Server Configuration File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The server settings are stored in :file:`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. 
Change according to the example below.

The complete configuration file described here is available for 
:download:`download <config-files/sshd_config>` also.

Network and Protocol Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We only allow SSH protocol version 2. Version 1 is insecure.

.. literalinclude:: config-files/sshd_config
    :language: ini
    :end-before: # HostKeys for protocol version 2


Server Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^

They point to our newly created set of *ed25519* and *RSA* host keys:

.. literalinclude:: config-files/sshd_config
    :language: ini
    :start-after: Protocol 2
    :end-before: # Authentication


Authentication Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *root* user is not allowed at all to login remotely. Others need their SSH
public- key installed. 

Password logins are not allowed.

.. literalinclude:: config-files/sshd_config
    :language: ini
    :start-after: HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
    :end-before: # Ciphers suite selections


Ciphers Suites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Same as with our :doc:`TLS settings <server-tls>` we limit our SSH server to a
safe and recommended set of encryption algorithms and set preferences as which
ones are preferred over others.


.. note::

    The supported cipher suites are highly dependent on the SSH software. Both 
    client and server must support it. 


**Key exchange:**

You can check which key exchange algorithms are supported by your version of
OpenSSH with the command :file:`ssh -Q kex`.

.. literalinclude:: config-files/sshd_config
    :language: ini
    :start-after: # Ciphers suite selections
    :end-before: # Symmetric ciphers


**Symmetric ciphers:**

You can check which symmetric ciphers are supported by your version of
OpenSSH with the command :file:`ssh -Q cipher`.

.. literalinclude:: config-files/sshd_config
    :language: ini
    :start-after: KexAlgorithms 
    :end-before: # Message authentication


**Message authentication (MAC):**

You can check which message integrity codes are supported by your version of
OpenSSH with the command :file:`ssh -Q mac`.

.. literalinclude:: config-files/sshd_config
    :language: ini
    :start-after: Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com 
    :end-before: # Allow client to pass locale environment variables


Other Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: config-files/sshd_config
    :language: ini
    :start-after: MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com


Restart SSH Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After the new host keys and sevrer configurations are in place, restart the SSH 
server::

    $ sudo restart ssh



SSH Client
----------

There will be SSH connections out of the server to other SSH servers (i.e. for
storing backups or accessing remote files). In that case, the server-system acts
as a client to a remote SSH server. Therefore also a "server" needs a well
configured SSH client.


Client Configuration File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The system-wide default client settings are stored in
:file:`/etc/ssh/ssh_config`. Change according to the example below:

.. code-block:: sh

    # Github supports neither AE nor Encrypt-then-MAC. LOL
    Host github.com
        MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,hmac-ripemd160-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512

    Host *
        KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256
        Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr
        MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,hmac-ripemd160-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-etm@openssh.com


Client Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^

As with the SSH server keys, we generate a fresh set of *ed25519* and *RSA*
client keys for our own user-profile::

    rm .ssh/id_* .ssh/id_*.pub
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096


The same has to be done also for the root user:: 

    sudo rm /root/.ssh/id_* /root/.ssh/id_*.pub
    sudo -sH ssh-keygen -t ed25519
    sudo -sH ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096


As well as for all other profiles on the system, who will initiate SSH client 
connections out of this system::

    sudo rm /home/<username>/.ssh/id_* /home/<username>/.ssh/id_*.pub
    sudo -u <username> -sH ssh-keygen -t ed25519
    sudo -u <username> -sH ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096


.. note::

    Don't forget to re-distribute your public client keys to any SSH servers you
    connect to from this host.


SSH and DNS
-----------

.. warning::

    If you domain is not secured with DNSSEC, you should **NOT** use this 
    feature, as the information received by the clients over DNS can not be 
    trusted.


The hash of the SSH server keys can be published in DNSSEC secured domains. 

By publishing a fingerprint of your SSH server public keys in DNS, connecting 
clients can verify the server identity, without the need to distribute and 
update your server public keys on all clients.

As of now RSA and ed25519 keys can both be published in DNS according to the
IANA assignments `DNS SSHFP Resource Record Parameters
<https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sshfp-rr-parameters/dns-sshfp-rr-parameters.xhtml>`_.
But OpenSSH isn't ready to read and check ed25519 fingerprints from DNS. The 
message "Error calculating host key fingerprint." will be displayed and keys 
need to be manually accepted.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * Setup your :doc:`DNS Sever </server/dns/powerdns>`
 * Secured your domain with :doc:`DNSSEC </server/dns/dnssec>`
 

Show DNS Record
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The 
`ssh-key-gen <http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/en/man1/ssh-keygen.1.html>`_ 
utility can be used to display the fingerprints of you host keys pre-formatted 
for publishing in DNS::

    $ ssh-keygen -r server.example.com. -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
    server.example.com. IN SSHFP 1 1 de63........................0851
    server.example.com. IN SSHFP 1 2 466b................................e409

The first line shows the SHA-1 fingerprint and the second line the SHA-256 
fingeprint of our RSA key.


If you use PowerDNS server with the  :doc:`Poweradmin web interface
</server/dns/poweradmin>`, add the SHA-256 record as follows:

===================== ===== ============================================
Name                  Type  Content                                                               
===================== ===== ============================================
server                SSHFP 1 2 466b................................e409
===================== ===== ============================================
