VoIP
====

VoIP stands for **V**\ oice **o**\ ver **IP**, which means using the Internet for
phone calls instead of the old and expensive switched telephone network.

In fact, all telephony providers today, use the internet as soon as a phone call
leaves your house. Many started forcing their customers to VoIP-technology. But
VoIP works alot like email, anybody can do it free of charge with some software
and some DNS records.
