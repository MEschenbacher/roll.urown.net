    # DNSSEC Settings
    #----------------------------------------

    # If true, disables the DNSSEC lameness check in the iterator. This check
    # sees if RRSIGs are present in the answer, when dnssec is expected, and
    # retries another authority if RRSIGs are unexpectedly missing. The
    # validator will insist in RRSIGs for DNSSEC signed domains regardless of
    # this setting, if a trust anchor is loaded.
    disable-dnssec-lame-check: no

    # File with trust anchor for one zone, which is tracked with RFC5011
    # probes. The probes are several times per month, thus the machine must be
    # online frequently. The initial file can be one with contents as
    # described in trust-anchor-file. The file is written to when the anchor
    # is updated, so the unbound user must have write permission. Write
    # permission to the file, but also to the directory it is in (to create a
    # temporary file, which is necessary to deal with filesystem full events),
    # it must also be inside the chroot (if that is used).
    # Default: "", 
    auto-trust-anchor-file: "/var/lib/unbound/root.key"

    # Send RFC8145 key tag query after trust anchor priming.
    # Default; yes
    #trust-anchor-signaling: yes

    # Root key trust anchor sentinel. 
    # Default: yes
    # root-key-sentinel: yes

    # Minimum number of seconds of clock skew to apply to validated signatures.
    # A value of 10% of the signature lifetime (expiration - inception) is used,
    # capped by this setting. Default is 3600 (1  hour) which allows for
    # daylight savings differences. Lower this value for more strict checking of
    # short lived signa-tures.
    # Default: 3600
    #val-sig-skew-min: 3600

    # Maximum number of seconds of clock skew to apply to validated signatures.
    # A value of 10% of the signature lifetime (expiration - inception)  is
    # used, capped by this setting. Default is 86400 (24 hours) which allows for
    # timezone setting problems in stable  domains. Setting both min and max
    # very low  disables the clock skew allowances. Setting both min and max
    # very high makes the validator check the signature timestamps less
    # strictly.
    # Default: 86400
    #val-sig-skew-max: 86400

    # The time to live for bogus data. This is data that has failed validation;
    # due to invalid signatures or other checks. The TTL from that data cannot
    # be trusted, and this value is used instead. The value is in seconds,
    # default 60. The time interval prevents repeated revalidation of bogus
    # data.
    # Default: 60
    #val-bogus-ttl: 60

    # Instruct the validator to remove data from the additional section of
    # secure messages that are not signed properly. Messages that are insecure,
    # bogus, indeterminate or unchecked are not affected. Default is yes. Use
    # this setting to protect the users that rely on this validator for
    # authentication from potentially bad data in the additional section.
    # Default: yes
    #val-clean-additional: yes

    # Have the validator print validation failures to the log. Regardless of the
    # verbosity setting. Default is 0, off. At 1, for every user query that
    # fails a line is printed to the logs. This way you can monitor what happens
    # with validation. Use a diagnosis tool, such as dig or drill, to find out
    # why validation is failing for these queries. At 2, not only the query that
    # failed is printed but also the reason why unbound thought it was wrong and
    # which server sent the faulty data.
    # Default: 0
    #val-log-level: 0

    # Instruct the validator to mark bogus messages as indeterminate. The
    # security checks are performed, but if the result is bogus (failed
    # security), the reply is not withheld from the client with SERVFAIL as
    # usual. The client receives the bogus data. For messages that are found to
    # be secure the AD bit is set in replies. Also logging is performed as for
    # full validation. The default value is "no".
    # Default: no
    #val-permissive-mode: no

    # Instruct unbound to ignore the CD flag from clients and refuse to return
    # bogus answers to them. Thus, the CD (Checking Disabled)   flag does not
    # disable checking any more. This is useful with legacy (Window 2008
    # servers) that set the CD flag but cannot validate  DNSSEC  themselves.
    # Like this Unbound still provides them with DNSSEC protection.
    # Default: no
    #ignore-cd-flag: no

    # List of keysize and iteration count values, separated by spaces,
    # surrounded by quotes. This determines the maximum allowed NSEC3 iteration
    # count before a message is simply marked insecure instead of performing the
    # many hashing iterations. The list must be in ascending order and have at
    # least one entry. If you set it to "1024 65535" there is no restriction  to
    # NSEC3 iteration values. This table must be kept short; a very long list
    # could cause slower operation.
    # Default: "1024 150 2048 500 4096 2500"
    #val-nsec3-keysize-iterations: "1024 150 2048 500 4096  2500"

    # Instruct the auto-trust-anchor-file probe mechanism for RFC5011 autotrust
    # updates to add new trust anchors only after they have been visible for this
    # time. Default is 30 days as per the RFC.
    # Default: 2629800
    #add-holddown: 2629800

    # Instruct the auto-trust-anchor-file probe mechanism for RFC5011 autotrust
    # updates to remove revoked trust anchors after they have been kept in the
    # revoked list for this long. Default is 30 days as per the RFC.
    # Default: 2629800
    #del-holddown: 2629800

    # Instruct the auto-trust-anchor-file probe mechanism for RFC5011 autotrust
    # updates to remove missing trust anchors after they have been unseen for
    # this long. This cleans up the state file if the target zone does not
    # perform trust anchor revocation, so this makes the auto probe mechanism
    # work with zones that perform regular (non-5011) rollovers. The default is
    # 366 days. The value 0 does not remove missing anchors, as per the RFC.
    # Default: 31536000
    #keep-missing: 31536000

    # Debug option that allows the autotrust 5011 rollover timers to assume very
    # small values.
    # Default: no
    #permit-small-holddown: no
