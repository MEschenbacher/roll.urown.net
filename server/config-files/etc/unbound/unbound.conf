# Unbound Version Version 1.11.0 (released 27 July, 2020)
# Linked libs: pluggable-libevent 2.1.11-stable (it uses epoll), 
#               OpenSSL 1.1.1h  22 Sep 2020
# Linked modules: dns64 respip validator iterator
# TCP Fastopen feature available

# OpenWrt specific notes:
#   
# Files are stored and maintened in /etc/unbound but copied to /var/lib/unbound 
# at runtine. While subdirectories of /etc/unbound will NOT be copied.
# Keep that in mind when including configuration files in Unbonud for OpenWrt.

    # Module configuration, a list of module names separated by spaces,
    # surround the string with quotes (""). The modules can be validator,
    # iterator. Setting this to "iterator" will result in a non-validating
    # server. Setting this to "validator iterator" will turn on DNSSEC
    # validation. The ordering of the modules is important.You must also set
    # trust-anchors for validation to be useful.
    module-config: "validator iterator"

    # Permit unbound to open this port or range of ports for use to send
    # queries. A larger number of permitted outgoing ports increases resilience
    # against spoofing attempts. Make sure these ports are not needed by other
    # daemons. By default only ports above 1024 that have not been assigned by
    # IANA are used. Give a port number or a range of the form "low-high",
    # without spaces.
    # The outgoing-port-permit and outgoing-port-avoid statements are processed
    # in the line order of the config file, adding the permitted ports and
    # subtracting the avoided ports from the set of allowed ports. The
    # processing starts with the non IANA allocated ports above 1024 in the set
    # of allowed ports.
    # OpenWrt default: "10240-65335"
    outgoing-port-permit: 38866-39680

    # Do not permit unbound to open this port or range of ports for use to send
    # queries. Use this to make sure unbound does not grab a port that another
    # daemon needs. The port is avoided on all outgoing interfaces, both IP4 and
    # IP6. By default only ports above 1024 that have not been assigned by IANA
    # are used. Give a port number or a range of the form "low-high", without
    # spaces.

    # Number of outgoing TCP buffers to allocate per thread. If set to 0, or if
    # do-tcp is "no", no TCP queries to authoritative servers are done. For larger
    # installations increasing this value is a good idea.
    # Default: 10. OpenWrt default: 1
    outgoing-num-tcp: 4

    # Number of incoming TCP buffers to allocate per thread. If set to 0, or if
    # do-tcp is "no", no  TCP  queries  from clients are accepted. For larger
    # installations increasing this value is a good idea.
    # Default: 10. OpenWrt default: 1

    # Detect source interface on UDP queries and copy them to replies. This
    # feature is experimental, and needs support in your OS for particular
    # socket options.
    # Default: no
    #interface-automatic: no

    # Number of bytes size to advertise as the EDNS reassembly buffer size. This
    # is the value put into datagrams over UDP towards peers. The actual buffer
    # size is determined by msg-buffer-size (both for TCP and UDP). Do not set
    # higher than that value. Default is 4096 which is RFC recommended. If you
    # have fragmentation reassembly problems, usually seen as timeouts, then a
    # value of 1472 can fix it. Setting to 512 bypasses even the most stringent
    # path MTU problems, but is seen as extreme, since the amount of TCP
    # fallback generated is excessive (probably also for this resolver, consider
    # tuning the outgoing tcp number).
    # Default; 4096
    #edns-buffer-size: 4096

    # Number of bytes size of the message buffers. The default of 65552 bytes is
    # enough for 64 Kb packets, the maximum DNS message size. No message larger
    # than this can be sent or received. Can be reduced to use less memory, but
    # some requests for DNS data, such as for huge resource records, will result
    # in a SERVFAIL reply to the client.
    # Default: 65552, OpenWrt default: 8192
    msg-buffer-size: 65552
