# ----------------------------------------
# Alias Addresses Mapping
# Postfix version 3.4.13
# ----------------------------------------
#
# The aliases(5) table provides a system-wide mechanism to redirect mail for
# local recipients. The redirections are processed by the Postfix local(8)
# delivery agent.
# An alias definition has the form
#     name: value1, value2, ...
# The name is a local address (no domain part). when an alias exists for
# owner-name, this will override the envelope sender address, so that
# delivery diagnostics are directed to owner-name.
# The value contains one or more of the following:
#     address             - Mail is forwarded to to a RFC 822 standard addres.
#     /file/name          - Mail is appended to /file/name.
#     |command            - Mail is piped into command.
#     :include:/file/name - Mail is sent to destinations listed in the file.
