# sender_canonical - Postfix sender_canonical table format
#
# Optional address mapping lookup tables for envelope and header sender
# addresses. The table format and lookups are documented in canonical(5).
#
# Example: you want to rewrite the SENDER address "user@ugly.domain" to
# "user@pretty.domain", while still being able to send mail to the RECIPIENT
# address "user@ugly.domain".
#
# Note: $sender_canonical_maps is processed before $canonical_maps.
#
# Run the following after changing this file:
#   $ cd /etc/postfix && sudo make"
