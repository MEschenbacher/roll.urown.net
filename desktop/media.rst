Media Services
==============

Depsite DLNA beeing an open and proven standard for media services in a home
network, the Ubuntu Linux situation is far from perfect.

Only a small number of projects, some abandoned. The default media player
applications, Rhythmbox for Music, Totem for Videos and Shotwell for Photos,
don't know nothing about DLNA.

The Pulseaudio sound framework has some support for playing audio over a local
network, but that doesn't work out of the box.
