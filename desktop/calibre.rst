`calibre <http://calibre-ebook.com/>`_ is a free and open source e-book library
management application developed by users of e-books for users of e-books. It
has a cornucopia of features divided into the following main categories:

 * Library Management
 * E-book conversion
 * Syncing to e-book reader devices
 * Downloading news from the web and converting it into e-book form
 * Comprehensive e-book viewer
 * Content server for online access to your book collection
 * E-book editor for the major e-book formats


Software Installation
---------------------

While calibre is available in the Ubuntu Software-Center, the `version available 
<apt://calibre>`_ is likely to be outdated.

The `download page <http://calibre-ebook.com/download_linux>`_ on the calibre
website provides a scary looking command line to download and install calibre
onn Linux desktop systems::

    $ sudo -v && \
        wget -nv -O- \
            https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kovidgoyal/calibre/master/setup/linux-installer.py |\
        sudo python -c "import sys; \
                        main=lambda:sys.stderr.write('Download failed\n'); \
                        exec(sys.stdin.read()); main()"


Synchronize with ownCloud
-------------------------

Calibre stores all books and its database in one directory (ususally called
:file:`Calibre Library` in your home directory). To access your collection of
electronic books from everywhere, especially with your reading and mobile
devices, synchronize this directory with :doc:`/desktop/owncloud-client`.

On the server-side, the library then is made available online by the
:doc:`/server/ebooks` server.


Digital Rights Management (DRM)
===============================

eBooks in the ePub-format protected by digital rights management (DRM).

Online libraries and book-shops sometimes distribute DRM protected files by
letting you download a file called :file:`URLLink.acsm`.

`Adobe Digital Editions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Digital_Editions>`_ 
is needed to access these eBooks. Since there is no Linux version of Adobe 
Digital Editions, the Windows version is installed under :doc:`/desktop/wine`.


Adobe Digital Editions (Adobe, 2011)
------------------------------------

::

    WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=${HOME}/.wine32 winetricks adobe_diged

This creates a new wine environment in the directory 
:file:`${HOME}/.local/share/wineprefixes/adobe_diged`.


Technical Background
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The download site will serve the :file:`URLLink.acsm` as mime-type 
`application/vnd.adobe.adept+xml`.

Firefox will lookup how to handle this content in a file called
:file:`mimeTypes.rdf` in your Mozilla Firefox profile directory:

.. code-block:: xml

    <RDF:Description RDF:about="urn:mimetype:handler:application/vnd.adobe.adept+xml"
                   NC:alwaysAsk="true"
                   NC:useSystemDefault="true"
                   NC:saveToDisk="false">
    <NC:externalApplication RDF:resource="urn:mimetype:externalApplication:application/vnd.adobe.adept+xml"/>
    </RDF:Description>

The part "externalApplication" essentially means, ask the operating system
desktop environment to handle this.

Ubuntu Desktop will lookup its own database, to find out how to handle this. You can query the database as follows:

::

    gvfs-mime --query application/vnd.adobe.adept+xml
    Registred Application:
        wine-extension-acsm.desktop
    Recommended Application:
        wine-extension-acsm.desktop

The :file:`wine-extension-acsm.desktop` is found in the
:file:`${HOME}/.local/share/applications` directory. It should contain the
command to start wine along with Adobe Digital Editions

:: 
    
    env WINEPREFIX="${HOME}/.local/share/wineprefixes/adobe_diged" wine explorer.exe


De-DRM eBooks
-------------

The good news is, you can remove DRM from your eBooks. There is a plugin for
Calibre, the eBook library application, which once installed, will do this
automatically with every eBook you add to your Calibre library.

The bad news is, its a bit complicated to setup:

We use Calibre under Linux, but the Adobe DRM stuff runs under Windows only. To
run windows programs in Linux, the Windows emulation software called wine is
used.

The scripts who do the magic of releasing your eBooks from DRM are Python
scripts. As those Python scripts must access the Adobe Digital stuff, they also
have to be run in the same emulated Windows environment. Therefore our wine
environment needs to be able to run Python scripts. A Python-version for Windows
must therefore be installed under the wine environment.

DRM is done by encrypting the media-content and decrypting it only for
authorized access. The scripts use Python modules for cryptography, which also
must be installed under the wine environment.


Python for Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`ActiveState Python for Windows 
<http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads>`_

Download the Python version 2.7.x (eg. 2.7.8.10 or newer) for Windows (x86).

Once  `downloaded 
<http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePython/releases/2.7.8.10/ActivePython-2.7.8.10-win32-x86.msi>`_, 
install it in our Adobe Digital Editions wine environment.

.. warning:: 

    Don't just duble-click the downloaded file, as this will install it in your default wine environment instead of the one used by your Adobe DRM software.

Use the following command-line to install it::
    
    cd Downloads
    env WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX="${HOME}/.local/share/wineprefixes/adobe_diged" wine start.exe ActivePython-2.7.8.10-win32-x86.msi


Python Crypto Modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`PyCrypto 2.1 for 32bit Windows and Python 2.7 
<http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#pycrypto>`_::

    cd Downloads
    env WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX="${HOME}/.local/share/wineprefixes/adobe_diged" wine pycrypto-2.6.win32-py2.7.exe


DeDRM Plugin for Calibre
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to `Apprentice Alfâ€™s Blog <http://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/>`_ and
download the tools archive :file:`tools_v6.0.9.zip` or newer from the link
provided: `<http://www.datafilehost.com/d/979ff0c7>`_.

Unzip the downloaded :file:`tools_v6.0.9.zip`.

Start Calibre and install the plugin by selecting the file :file:`tools_v6.0.9/DeDRM_calibre_plugin/DeDRM_plugin.zip`.
