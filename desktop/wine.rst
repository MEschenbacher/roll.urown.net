Wine
====

`Wine <https://www.winehq.org>`_ (originally an acronym for "Wine Is Not an
Emulator") is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on
several POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, Mac OSX, & BSD.
Instead of simulating internal Windows logic like a virtual machine or emulator,
Wine translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls on-the-fly, eliminating the
performance and memory penalties of other methods and allowing you to cleanly
integrate Windows applications into your desktop.
