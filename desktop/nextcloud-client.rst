Nextcloud File Synchronization
==============================

The Nextcloud desktop app lets you always have your latest files wherever you
are. Just specify one or more folders on the local machine to and a server to
synchronize to. You can configure more computers to synchronize to the same
server and any change to the files on one computer will silently and reliably
flow across to every other.

The **nextcloud-desktop** package provides the graphical client to manage
synchronization with the cloud storage provided by Nextcloud.

The **nautilus-nextcloud** package is an extension for Nautilus (the Gnome
file-manager), which will integrate the Nextcloud web service with your desktop
file manager.

::

    $ sudo apt install nextcloud-desktop nautilus-nextcloud
