GSConnect
---------

GSConnect is a complete implementation of "KDE Connect" especially for GNOME Shell
with Nautilus, Chrome and Firefox integration. It does not rely on the KDE
Connect desktop application and will not work with it installed.

"KDE Connect" allows devices to securely share content like notifications or
files and other features like SMS messaging and remote control. The "KDE
Connect" team has applications for Linux, BSD, Android, Sailfish and Windows.

KDE Connect Indicator can support Gtk desktops other than GNOME Shell.
