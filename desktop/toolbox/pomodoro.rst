Pomodoro Technique
==================

The `Pomodoro Technique <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique>`_ is
a time management method developed by `Francesco Cirillo
<https://francescocirillo.com/>`_ in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer
to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated
by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for
'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a
university student.

The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and websites
providing timers and instructions. Closely related to concepts such as
timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design,
the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts.

Pomodoro Indicator App
----------------------

The `Pomodoro-Indicator <https://github.com/atareao/pomodoro-indicator>`_ app
facilitates the use of the Pomodoro technique in Ubuntu, being able to manage it
in two simple ways, or, through the mouse wheel that can start or deter the
procedure, or directly from the menu options, by pressing the corresponding
start or stop.
