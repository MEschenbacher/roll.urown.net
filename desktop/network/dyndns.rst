DNS Updates
-----------

Non-servers, like personal computers, desktop or laptops/notebooks usually get
a dynamic temporary address. Portable devices might connect from different
networks.

The :file:`nsupdate` programm can contact your :doc:`domain name server
</server/dns/powerdns>` and update your hostname with the current address.

Nowadays NetworkManager is in charge of all these things, so updates should be
managed by that too.
